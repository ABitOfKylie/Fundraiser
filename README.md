# Fundraiser
A short example of node.js, express, mongodb, mongoose. This is one part of a planned series of tools for school organizations. This app organizes information on past school fundraisers, profit/loss, vendor information and inventory/rentals. Publicity and Communication (using MailChimp API) will be added later. Log in and auth using passport-google, passport-facebook and passport-twitter strategies. Non-essential frills: google fonts, font awesome favicon, glyphicons, animate.css.
